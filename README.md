This lab involves using the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) framework to evaluate the security of a new mobile app for a sneaker company. The main goal is to ensure the application is safe to launch by identifying and mitigating potential security risks.

Key Steps and Focus Areas:

Business and Security Objectives: The app will process transactions, involve significant back-end processing, and needs to comply with industry regulations concerning data privacy. Objectives include seamless user experience, secure payment handling, and managing user data responsibly.

Technical Scope: Technologies like API, PKI, AES, SHA-256, and SQL are prioritized for their roles in secure data management and encryption.

Decomposition: The applicationâ€™s processes are broken down using data flow diagrams to visualize secure data handling.

Threat Analysis: Internal threats like unauthorized access and external threats such as social engineering or attacks on authentication systems are identified.

Vulnerability Analysis: Focus is placed on vulnerabilities such as code weaknesses, database risks, and network flaws.

Attack Modeling: An attack tree is created to understand potential attack vectors, helping prioritize security measures.

Risk Analysis and Security Controls: Implementing security controls like regular audits, intrusion detection systems, data encryption, and strong authentication to reduce risks.

This lab emphasizes a comprehensive approach to securing the app through various stages of threat modeling, ensuring that security is a fundamental aspect of the application's development process.
